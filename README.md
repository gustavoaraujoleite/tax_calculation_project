This is a personal project that I developed for my parents in order for them to calculate their monthly taxes deduction.

The goal was to develope a simple program that they can use, and build it to their specific needs (main reason why I have not used an API). 

This project was first developed in Python programming language a couple of months ago, and I decided to updated it with a better interface and also take advantage to practice my HTML, CSS and JS skills.

It is mainly in Portuguese and includes translation. The ones that don't have an english translation is because it is a specific tax name from Brazil.
